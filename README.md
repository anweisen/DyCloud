# DyCloud
A minecraft cloud system using docker & netty supporting multiroot & multiproxy for learning purpose

**This project is only intended as a learning experience**.
You should **not use this cloud system for production**, as no support will be given and the project may be very inactive and lack features.

I would recommend you to use one of the **following cloud systems**:
- [CloudNet-v3](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3)
- [CloudNet-v2](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet)
- [SimpleCloud](https://github.com/theSimpleCloud/SimpleCloud)
- [TimoCloud](https://github.com/TimoCloud/TimoCloud)

## Structure

- **master** (*base*): <br>
  Manager of the cloud, commander of nodes <br>
  *Maybe known as manager or base from other cloud systems*
- **node** (*base, remote*): <br>
  Responsible for starting & stopping of services (minecraft servers, bungee proxies), connects to the master. <br>
  *Probably known as wrapper or slave from other cloud system*
- **wrapper** (*remote*): <br>
  Runs a service, connects to the master. <br>
  *Probably known as runner or bridge from other cloud systems*

## Permissions

- **cloud.join.maintenance**: Player with this permission will be able to join during maintenance (*Cloud-Bridge*)
- **cloud.join.full**: Player with this permission will be able to join although the server is full (*Cloud-Bridge*)
- **cloud.auto.op**: Player with this permission will automatically be set as operators on bukkit servers (*Cloud-Perms*)
- **cloud.notify**: Player with this permission will receive messages when services are started/stopped (*Cloud-Notify*)
- **cloud.chat.color**: Player with this permission will be able to send colored message using ``&`` (*Cloud-ChatTab*)
- **cloud.command.use**: Player with this permission will be able to use ``/cloud`` commands (*Cloud.Bridge*)

## Modules

- **Bridge**: Allows the use of player management possible <br>
- **Perms**: Allows the use of an integrated permission system <br>
- **Cloudflare**: Allows the use of a multiproxy setup using round-robin dns load balancing <br>
- **Notify**: Allows the sending of service update messages to players <br>
- **Proxy**: Allows the use of proxy systems & configs <br>
  - Tablist Replacements:
    - ``{ping}`` The ping of the player provided by the proxy
    - ``{name}`` The name of the player
    - ``{server}`` The name of the server the player is currently on
    - ``{proxy}`` The name of the proxy the player is connected to
    - ``{node}`` The name of the proxy's node the player is connected to
    - ``{group.name}`` The name of the player's highest group
    - ``{group.color}`` The color of the player's highest group
    - ``{group.display}`` The display name of the player's highest group
    - ``{players.online}`` The count of online players on the network
    - ``{players.max}`` The max count of player on the network defined in *global.json* as *maxPlayers*
  - Motd Replacements:
    - ``{proxy}`` The name of the proxy the player is pinging
    - ``{node}`` The name of the proxy's node the player is pinging
    - ``{players.online}`` The count of online players on the network
    - ``{players.max}`` The max count of player on the network defined in *global.json* as *maxPlayers*
- **ChatTab**: Runtime module to enable the use of chat formatting & name tags
  - Message Replacements:
    - ``{message}`` The message sent by the player
    - ``{player.uuid}`` The uuid of the player
    - ``{player.name}`` The name of the player
    - ``{player.display}`` The display name of the player
    - ``{group.name}`` The name of the player's highest group
    - ``{group.color}`` The color of the player's highest group
    - ``{group.display}`` The display name of the player's highest group
